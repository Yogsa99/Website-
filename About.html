        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
        We are an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. It is also a directory of nearly 11,000 
        animal shelters and adoption organizations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Organizations maintain their own 
        home pages and available-pet databases.
        </p>
        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <h3>To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            1. Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets</br>
            2. Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the extent 
                that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated</br>    
            3. Elevate the status of pets to that of family member</br>
        </p>

            From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their 
            needs. They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder 
            also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles 
            to help keep pets in their homes.Our Site is updated DAILY.
            Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact person should be responsible for direct 
            communications with Petfinder. Only nonprofit organizations will be included (but Federal 501(c)(3) 
            status is not necessary).

            We are made up of animal-care professionals and regular people volunteering for their local animal 
            welfare organizations all working together to maintain active and accurate homeless pet lists. Most 
            animal welfare volunteers have “real jobs” by day. The success and the magnitude of this project is 
            largely due to their tireless efforts to make a difference. If you would like to help, let us know!

            If you have a Website and would like to help us promote shelter pets as the #1 choice for a new pet, 
            you may use our free widgets and graphics to add Petfinder to your website. You may also want to check 
            out our Featured Pet Module which allows you to show Petfinder pets from your community on your own home page.

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            We are only a directory of homeless pets and pet adoption organizations. No information in Petfinder 
            is guaranteed. Although the information on Petfinder is updated frequently, it is always best to call 
            the facility or organization that lists the pet to insure it is still available and to insure the 
            information listed in is accurate. It is crucial that any pet found through an adoption service be 
            thoroughly examined by a veterinarian immediately upon adoption. Any pets found, adopted through, or 
            listed in Petfinder are the sole responsibility of the adoption organizations and/or the adopting party.
            We accepts no responsiblity for any liability or for any injury or damages to any person or property 
            caused by any listed animal, as well as any cause of action, claims, suits or demands whatsoever that 
            may arise as a result of such injury or damage.
